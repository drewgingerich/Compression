* Make ball come over edge when sliding up wall
  Falling straight back down is very unsatisfying
* Make rebound strength charge for the first ~0.25 seconds
  Add a bit of timing, which can help make the rebound feel powerful
  Aka make what the compression animation implies into a mechanic
* After a timeout in the rebound state, transition to the compressed state
  No one wants the ball to be launched for them, yo.
* Think about a way to cancel the launch
  Aim away from wall to cancel?
