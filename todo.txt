Maybe have "stages" of launch intensity instead of the smooth scaling I have now?
Detect impact direction
	Change launch angle range to center on a reflection of the impact vector
Detect impact magnitude
	Scale launch magnitude directly with impact magnitude
	At high impact magnitude, leave crack decal & make ball smoke/on fire
Re-introduce sticky mechanic
Re-introduce launches shortly after impact having a greater magnitude.
